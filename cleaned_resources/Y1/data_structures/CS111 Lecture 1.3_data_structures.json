World!\" << endl;\nreturn 0;\n}\nProgramming in Dev C++\nOur first program: Hello World\nCompilation\nFrom C+++ for Everyone\nProgramming in Dev C++\nIf no errors are reported, the compiler creates an executable\nversion of the code which we can run directly by:\nClicking \"execute\" or \"run\" button in the menu, or\no\nExecute -> Run menu option or\no\nF9 function key.\no\nProgramming in Dev C++\nUnfortunately, unlike most glamorous windows programs, the\noutput produced by our programs will be on a\nDOS screen.\nSometimes referred to console based programming\nProgramming in Dev C++\nConsole!\nSTART -> Programs -> Accessories -> Command Prompt\nProgramming in Dev C++\nNote: if you change your program and click the execute button\nwithout compiling first, Dev C++ uses the previous compiled\nexecutable version of the code.\nRule of thumb:\nAlways compile your program before running \u2018em.\nProgramming in Dev C++\nCONGRATULATIONS!\nIf it works.\nHowever, being a programmer we must realize that a working\nprogram will not necessarily do the right thing you intend it to\ndo.\nThere is an art and a craft in getting a program to\nWork without bugs.\no\nDo what you want it to do.\no\nHOW? We'll tell you in this course.\nEthics of Programming\nNow that you have written your first program, some rules:\nA programmer must...\n\uf0a7 Never take credit for another's work.\n\uf0a7 Always acknowledge the work of other programmers.\n\uf0a7 Never write code that is intentionally difficult to understand.\n\uf0a7 Never conceal the deficiencies of other programmers by writing code for them\nand allowing them to pass it off as their own work.\n\uf0a7 Never reuse copyrighted code unless the proper license is purchased or\npermission is obtained.\n\uf0a7 Stay current on the advancement of the field of Computer Science.\nEthics of Programming\nA programmer must...\n\uf0a7 Never falsely deny the presence of bugs.\n\uf0a7 Never intentionally introduce bugs.\n\uf0a7 Never write code that is deliberately inefficient\n\uf0a7 Never write documentation that is intentionally confusing or inaccurate.\n\uf0a7 Never dishonestly downplay the difficulty of completing a project.\n\uf0a7 Never reveal the confidential knowledge or code.\n\uf0a7 Never misrepresent their knowledge, experience, or abilities.\nEthics of Programming\nMany organizations have their code of conducts, or code of ethics:\n\uf0a7 The previous list of rules was taken from\nhttp://www.gammadyne.com/ethics.htm\n\uf0a7 See Moodle for the Code of Conduct of the Australian\nComputer Society (ACS).\n\uf0a7 Of course, there are also the university rules on plagiarism.\n",
