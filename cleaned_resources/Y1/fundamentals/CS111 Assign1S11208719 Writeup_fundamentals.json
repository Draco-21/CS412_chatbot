Hotel1 \u2013 Marriot, Hotel2 \u2013 Hilton, Hotel3 \u2013 Uprising, Hotel4 \u2013 Grand Pacific Hotel, Hotel5 \u2013\nSheraton, Quit \u2013 Exit, pc1, pc2, pc3, pc4, pc5, MV, HV, UV, GV, SV, vv, t_inv, inv, tvv, tv,\nwinner, draw1, draw2, draw3, draw4, draw5, percent, selection.\n2. Selection\n3. Int was used for selection and because all hotels were listed as a whole number. Strings\nwere used for hotel names and winner displaying because they were words. Double was\nused for all votes and percentage because the votes and percentage were to be displayed in\ndecimals.\n4. While loop is the best to validate the input because the user can input infinite times unless\nthe condition (selection != 6) is false.\nExercise 3\nTest 1 \u2013 All expected inputs were entered. The correct way of voting as instructed.\nAnd the expected outputs were printed to signify that the code works properly.\nTest 2 \u2013 For this test, I chose alphabets to test if my input validation works. When an\nalphabets was entered, the program gave a warning as expected.\nTest 3 \u2013 For the last test, I voted all the hotels equally (i.e 2 for marriot, 2 for Hilton and so\non) to test if it showed a draw and as expected the program showed a draw\namongst the 5 hotels.\nExercise 4\nNo, this is not ethical to do because it violates 3 of the 6 important ACS Code of Ethics. It goes\nagainst the 1st ACS code of ethics which is \u201cThe Primacy of the Public Interest\u201d which states that the\nprogrammer should put the public\u2019s interest foremost compared to his own or sectional interest. It\nalso goes against another COE, \u201cHonesty\u201d, whereby the programmer isn\u2019t honest towards his coding\nand create a bug whereby the program is biased. And it also disrespects the members of the society\nwhich is another COE, \u201cProfessionalism\u201d. This behavior also violates numerous programming ethics\nsuch as hiding the bug, defaming etc.\nExercise 5\n1. No\n2. No\n3. Yes\n4. Yes\n5. Yes\n6. Yes\n\n",
