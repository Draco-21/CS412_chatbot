The group of symbols is called as a code.\nThe digital data is represented, stored and transmitted as group of binary bits. This group is also\ncalled as binary code. The binary code is represented by the number as well as alphanumeric\nletter.\nAdvantages of Binary Code\nFollowing is the list of advantages that binary code offers.\nBinary codes are suitable for the computer applications.\nBinary codes are suitable for the digital communications.\nBinary codes make the analysis and designing of digital circuits if we use the binary codes.\nSince only 0 & 1 are being used, implementation becomes easy.\nClassification of binary codes\nThe codes are broadly categorized into following four categories.\nWeighted Codes\nNon-Weighted Codes\nBinary Coded Decimal Code\nAlphanumeric Codes\nError Detecting Codes\nError Correcting Codes\nWeighted Codes\nWeighted binary codes are those binary codes which obey the positional weight principle. Each\nposition of the number represents a specific weight. Several systems of the codes are used to\nexpress the decimal digits 0 through 9. In these codes each decimal digit is represented by a\ngroup of four bits.\nNon-Weighted Codes\nIn this type of binary codes, the positional weights are not assigned. The examples of non-weighted\ncodes are Excess-3 code and Gray code.\nExcess-3 code\nThe Excess-3 code is also called as XS-3 code. It is non-weighted code used to express decimal\nnumbers. The Excess-3 code words are derived from the 8421 BCD code words adding 00112 or 3\n10 to each code word in 8421. The excess-3 codes are obtained as follows \u2212\nExample\nGray Code\nIt is the non-weighted code and it is not arithmetic codes. That means there are no specific weights\nassigned to the bit position. It has a very special feature that, only one bit will change each time\nthe decimal number is incremented as shown in fig. As only one bit changes at a time, the gray\ncode is called as a unit distance code. The gray code is a cyclic code. Gray code cannot be used\nfor arithmetic operation.\nApplication of Gray code\nGray code is popularly used in the shaft position encoders.\nA shaft position encoder produces a code word which represents the angular position of the\nshaft.\nBinary Coded Decimal BCD code\nIn this code each decimal digit is represented by a 4-bit binary number. BCD is a way to express\neach of the decimal digits with a binary code. In the BCD, with four bits we can represent sixteen\nnumbers 0000to1111. But in BCD code only first ten of these are used 0000to1001. The remaining six\ncode combinations i.e. 1010 to 1111 are invalid in BCD.\nAdvantages of BCD Codes\nIt is very similar to decimal system.\nWe need to remember binary equivalent of decimal numbers 0 to 9 only.\nDisadvantages of BCD Codes\nThe addition and subtraction of BCD have different rules.\nThe BCD arithmetic is little more complicated.\nBCD needs more number of bits than binary to represent the decimal number. So BCD is less\nefficient than binary.\nAlphanumeric codes\nA binary digit or bit can represent only two symbols as it has only two states '0' or '1'. But this is not\nenough for communication between two computers because there we need many more symbols\nfor communication. These symbols are required to represent 26 alphabets with capital and small\nletters, numbers from 0 to 9, punctuation marks and other symbols.\nThe alphanumeric codes are the codes that represent numbers and alphabetic characters. Mostly\nsuch codes also represent other characters such as symbol and various instructions necessary for\nconveying information. An alphanumeric code should at least represent 10 digits and 26 letters of\nalphabet i.e. total 36 items. The following three alphanumeric codes are very commonly used for\nthe data representation.\nAmerican Standard Code for Information Interchange ASCII.\nExtended Binary Coded Decimal Interchange Code EBCDIC.\nFive bit Baudot Code.\nASCII code is a 7-bit code whereas EBCDIC is an 8-bit code. ASCII code is more commonly used\nworldwide while EBCDIC is used primarily in large IBM computers.\nError Codes\nThere are binary code techniques available to detect and correct data during data transmission.\nError Code Description\nError detection and correction code techniques\nError Detection and\nCorrection\nLoading [MathJax]/jax/output/HTML-CSS/jax.js\n",
